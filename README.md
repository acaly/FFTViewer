# FFTViewer
A simple visualization tool of mp3 files using Fast Fourier Transformation.

Very useful tool for making notations of the melody or identifying the chords in a piece of music.

## Usage
* Open a mp3 file (no supports for other formats) in the dialog.
* Use the 3 buttons at the top right ([>]  [ || ]  [O]) to control the playing.
* Double click on the top bar to play from any position.
* Use the 2 buttons on the right ([+] [-]) to control the height of the peaks and the color of the spectrum.
* Use the 4 buttons on the left ([<<] [<] [>] [>>]) to move peaks to the left or right, for music in scales other than C major or A minor.
* Use the 2 buttons (vertical) on the left to control the scrolling speed.
* Use the button to the left of playing control ([L] for default, switching between [L], [R], and [x]) to switch between left channel, right channel, and the difference. The difference mode is useful when you don't want the vocal sometimes.
